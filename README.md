# Automated Pre-Play Analysis of American Football Formations
---

## üìñ Overview

This repository implements a **modular pipeline** for detecting and classifying offensive formations in American
football from broadcast video. The project builds upon the paper:

> **Automated Pre-Play Analysis of American Football**  
> Lasse Wilhelm, Justin Getzke  
> University of Cologne, 2025

The pipeline integrates:

- **Roboflow 3.0 model** for player detection
- **Homography-based field registration** using yard lines & hash marks
- **Formation classification** based on personnel grouping (RB, TE, WR) and positional alignment
- **Visualization tools** for annotated broadcast frames and standardized bird‚Äôs-eye views

The system achieves **formation recognition accuracy on par with expert human analysts**, while reducing the time
required for analysis from hours to minutes.

- üèà **Player Detection**: Custom trained Roboflow 3.0  model for offensive line, QB, skill players, defense, referees
- üìê **Field Registration**: Detects yard lines & hash marks, computes homography for top-down scaling
- üìä **Formation Classification**: Classifies offensive personnel groups (10, 11, 12, ‚Ä¶) + alignment (L/R balance, TE
  positions)
- üñº **Visualization**: Annotated broadcast frames + top-down tactical diagrams

## Project Architecture

### High-Level Overview
This desktop app packages a **Next.js** UI inside a **Tauri** shell and spawns a **Python FastAPI** server as a *sidecar* process. The Python service runs the vision/ML pipeline (player detection, field registration via homography, formation classification) and exposes HTTP endpoints that the UI calls for analysis and visualization. The result is a single, cross-platform binary with native performance and a modern web UI. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Tech stack**
- **Shell:** Tauri (Rust) with a sidecar for the backend
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind/Shadcn (per `components.json`)
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI + required CV/ML deps (see [requirements.txt](`requirements.txt`))
- **Artifacts:** Annotated frames and bird‚Äôs-eye/top-down projections of formations :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Model:** Roboflow 3.0 model for player detection

### Modules & Boundaries
- **Tauri (src-tauri/‚Ä¶)**  
  - Configures the desktop window and registers a **sidecar** binary/command to launch the FastAPI server alongside the UI.
  - Manages app lifecycle signals (spawn/kill) and forwards logs for debugging.
- **Frontend (src/‚Ä¶ with Next.js)**  
  - Pages and components to load media, trigger analyses, and render results (bounding boxes, LOS overlays, top-down diagrams).
  - Calls backend endpoints (e.g., `/analyze-snap`) via `fetch`.
- **Backend (src-python/‚Ä¶ with FastAPI)**  
  - Endpoints for: frame extraction, detection, homography solve, formation classify, and asset retrieval.
  - Pipelines orchestrated as Python services utilizing the ML/CV libraries declared in `requirements.txt`.

# üèÉ Usage

## Application Setup

This guide walks you through running the **football-pre-play-analysis** desktop application using **Tauri** with a **Next.js** frontend and a **Python FastAPI** sidecar.

> For feature walkthrough and how to use the UI, please refer to the **provided video**.

---

### Prerequisites

Install these tools first and ensure they are available on your PATH.

- **Rust** (via `rustup`) and **Cargo**
  - Check: `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`
- **Node.js** (LTS recommended) and **pnpm**
  - Check: `node -v`, `pnpm -v`
  - Install pnpm if needed: `npm i -g pnpm`
- **Python 3.11** and **pip**
  - Check: `python --version` (or `python3 --version`), `pip --version`
- **git**

### Platform-specific notes

- **Windows**
  - Install **Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools** (Desktop development with C++).
  - Ensure **WebView2 Runtime** is installed (usually present on Win10+).
- **macOS**
  - Install **Xcode Command Line Tools**: `xcode-select --install`
- **Linux**
  - Install system deps as required by Tauri/WebKitGTK (e.g., `webkit2gtk`, `gtk3`, `libappindicator`).
  - Package names vary by distro; see your distro‚Äôs package manager.

---

### Setup

1) **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jxstixn/football-pre-play-analysis.git
cd football-pre-play-analysis
```

2) **Install Next.js (frontend) dependencies**
```bash
pnpm i
```

3) **Install Python (backend) dependencies**
> Optional but recommended: create a virtual environment first.

```bash
# (optional) create & activate a venv
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate

# install backend deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) **Build the FastAPI sidecar**
> Choose the command for your platform.

```bash
# Windows
pnpm build:sidecar-windows

# macOS
pnpm build:sidecar-macos

# Linux
pnpm build:sidecar-linux
```

This step compiles/builds the Python FastAPI sidecar (or prepares its executable/bundle) so Tauri can spawn it at runtime.

---

### Run the App (Development)

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

- Tauri will start the desktop shell, serve the Next.js frontend, and **spawn the Python FastAPI sidecar**.
- Watch the terminal for logs. The application will open a desktop window automatically.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Sidecar not found / fails to spawn**
  - Verify sidecar build step completed successfully for your OS.
  - Check paths in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (command, args, and working directory).
- **Python version / packages mismatch**
  - Confirm you‚Äôre using **Python 3.11**.
  - Reinstall deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (in your active venv).
- **Port conflicts**
  - If the sidecar binds to `127.0.0.1:<port>`, ensure that port is free or update config and frontend env accordingly.
- **Windows build issues**
  - Ensure **MSVC Build Tools** are installed; try opening a fresh **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt**.
- **macOS ‚ÄúApp is damaged or can‚Äôt be opened‚Äù**
  - Gatekeeper/quarantine may block unsigned builds; you may need to allow the app in **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**.
- **Linux missing dependencies**
  - Install WebKitGTK/GTK3 packages per your distro; restart the app.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

### 4. Prepare your input clips

- Place raw football match clips (MP4) into the **same folder** as the [football_play_cutting.ipynb](notebooks/football_play_cutting.ipynb).

---

### 5. Run the cutting notebook

- Open [football_play_cutting.ipynb](notebooks/football_play_cutting.ipynb).
- Run all cells ‚Äî this will cut the video into frames.  

---

### 6. Run the analysis pipeline

- Open [football_pre_play_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/football_pre_play_analysis.ipynb).
- Adjust the **file paths** to point to the extracted images.  
- Run the cells in order.

---

### 7. Review Results
